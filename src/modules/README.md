# Modules

Modules are defined in this directory.

## Contributing

To add a custom module follow these steps:

1. Add a enum member to the `Module` enum in `./mod.rs`
2. Write the match arm.
3. Now you can use this module in your `config.rs`

If you decide to implement a custom module I would be glad to see a pr :)
